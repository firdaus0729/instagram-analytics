**Solutions:**

   - Settings → Instagram
   - Make sure your Instagram account is connected

3. Verify Business Account Status:
   - Instagram App → Settings → Account

**Solutions:**
- Ensure your account is at least a few days old

- Check if your account is in good standing (not restricted)

### Still Having Issues?

1. **Log out and log back in** to Instagram
2. **Unlink and re-link** your Facebook Page
